EMERALD'S KILLFEED ‚Äî COMMAND SYSTEM AUDIT & TIMEOUT FIX

üß© TASK TYPE: SINGLE TASK ‚Äî FULL-STACK REPAIR

This task must be completed as a single uninterrupted batch operation. Do not checkpoint, commit, or output until every step has been executed, all issues are fixed, and commands are confirmed responsive in production.

# [PHASE 1] ‚Äî COMMAND EXECUTION AUDIT & TIMEOUT DIAGNOSIS

‚ö†Ô∏è Observed Issue:

Most slash commands time out without responding

Commands appear to defer but never reply

Commands may not correctly interact with the database or embed systems



---

üî¨ Objectives:

1. Audit every slash command definition

Ensure they all use @discord.slash_command() and discord.Option(...) correctly

Confirm that await ctx.defer() is used only when necessary

Check that ctx.followup.send(...) or ctx.respond(...) is always called and not skipped



2. Review database access logic

Confirm all calls to db_manager match actual method definitions

Patch invalid or misaligned queries (e.g., calling non-existent methods or wrong parameters)

Ensure all queries await properly (e.g., await self.bot.db_manager.method(...))

Avoid .then()-style or sync-like chaining from older discord.py paradigms



3. Enforce Pycord 2.6.1 compliance

Remove all legacy syntax from discord.py

Replace @bot.command, commands.Context, ctx.send() etc. with their Pycord slash equivalents

Remove any use of commands.Cog.listener() in favor of Pycord‚Äôs @bot.event



4. Validate interoperation between commands and other systems

Ensure each command interacts correctly with:

Guild/server isolation

EmbedFactory usage

MongoDB document structure

Parsers, SFTP logic, and stats handlers




5. Fix logic flow issues

Check for any infinite loops, await chains that never resolve, or circular logic that may prevent response

Ensure commands never call blocking operations or misstructured async tasks

Confirm each command has a clear endpoint and return statement



6. Command Timeout Repair

Diagnose cause of timeout by tracing each command's execution start to finish

If a command takes longer than 3 seconds before responding, move processing to a background task or thread

Use ctx.defer() appropriately and always follow with a reply (even if error)





---

‚úÖ COMPLETION CHECKLIST:

[ ] All slash commands correctly respond with no timeouts

[ ] Commands do not enter infinite loops or crash silently

[ ] Each command uses proper Pycord 2.6.1 structure

[ ] Commands align with actual db_manager methods (no undefined calls)

[ ] All commands reply with valid embeds using EmbedFactory

[ ] No unresolved exceptions or stack traces in terminal

[ ] Slash commands reflect correct isolation for guild/server

[ ] Commands interoperate with all other systems cleanly

üîí EXECUTION RULES

This is a single batch task

Do not checkpoint, log, or output early

You must complete all command auditing and fixes before responding

Treat missing replies as system failures ‚Äî resolve root cause

You may not skip or stub any command logic

Validate all logic with live testing before considering the task complete
